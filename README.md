## Warning
This application includes content that some may find sensitive. The analysis contains details on suicides, which may be unsettling to some users. We kindly request that you proceed only if you feel comfortable doing so. Thank you for your understanding.

## Overview 
The DashSuicides app outlines a solution to understand the correlation between suicides and various socio-economic factors globally. The goal is to build a data visualization app, complement to [this app](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/suicide_indicator_r) that allows doctors and mental health researchers to explore a dataset of suicides in countries around the world. The data used in this project is a Kaggle dataset that contains 31,756 global observations from 1985 to 2021 based on various socio-economic factors such as country, GDP, age, and gender. The app will visualize data from multiple perspectives, besides what have already been in [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/suicide_indicator_r). It provides interactive bar plot, as well as bubble plot of world wide suicides counts. The target users of the app are medical professionals such as psychiatrists, nurses, or doctors who want to understand how suicide rates have changed between countries over time. The app is designed for users with moderate data/computer literacy and allows them to compare, visualize, and dissect the suicide dataset into their population of interest.

## Usage 
![fig](https://github.com/ZilongYi/DashSuicides/blob/main/image/Screenshot%202023-03-22%20at%204.49.05%20PM.png)

As we can see, there are two filters on the left side of the app, `Year` and `Sex`. Users can play with it. Once values for these two values have been set, Corresponding suicide counts, as well as two plots will change accordingly. 

Note range of `Year` is **1985-2020**
